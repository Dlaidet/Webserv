<h1>Welcome to the FoxServ 1.0 testing website!</h1>
<h4>If you see this page, it is served by FoxServ and that mean it is working. Hoorah!</h4>
<p>Welcome to this index.html web page. (that mean your index is index.html in conf)</p>
<p>Here's a link to a simple static <a href="page.html">web page</a> with image, css and javascript.</p>
<p>Here's a link to test <a href="cgi.html">cgi</a> with forms (GET and POST).</p>
<p>This link <a href="xxx.html">will do a 404</a>.</p>
<p>You can see a directory listing going to this link <a href="content/"> url</a> (need GET permission and autoindex on in conf).</p>
<p>This python script should not execute and display as <a href="test.py">plain text</a> (execute it by changing the directory in python scripts).</p>
<p>Try to go to and url "files/x.txt" and this will do a <a href="files/x">redirection to index</a> (need rewrite in conf).</p>
<p><em>Thank you for using FoxServ and see ya!</em></p>
